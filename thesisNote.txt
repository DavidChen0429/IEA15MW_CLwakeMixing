Limtatation: Practiality for simulation about real-time control(anything about online control technique), whereas offline state estimation is not a problem

=========== Research questions
* How to integrate LIDAR and the helix approach for closed-loop active wake mixing control for wind farms? (WWH)
	-> What: Use LIDAR as a feedback mechanism to achieve closed-loop control of helix approach.
	-> Why: The lack of information and the complicated dynamic inside the wind farm makes accurate control impossible to achieve without feedback. Plus, the surrogate model used in open-loop control is only accurate in particular situations and do not suffice for all conditions relevant throughout the annual operation of the wind farm.
	-> How: Downwind facing LIDAR sampling windspeed data, a pipeline to process data, an optimal controller to rectify control. Furthermore, relation of wake and power production of downstream turbine is studied. This furthermore create data-driven control.

** Which LIDAR configuration to use?\
	-> ZX TM LIDAR (commerical realization) 
		Scan: Continuous Wave
		Sample rate: 50Hz
		Range: 10m-550m
		Half cone angle: 15 degrees 
		
** What features in the wake should be extracted for control purposes?
** How to use LIDAR measurement to obtain information about those features?
** How to design the control system to rectify active wake mixing?
** How can a deeper understanding of active wake mixing from LIDAR be combined with data-driven control strategies to enhance WFFC?

Control the wake center through changing Mtilt and Myaw magnitude --- Steps:
	1. Simulation of different cases
	2. Find relationship between the Mtilt and Myaw to the position of wake center
	3. Find the way to solve the time-delay problem of control
	4. Design a double PI controllers to deal with the problem
	5. Learning-based MPC

Simulation Purpose:
	1. Find a right resolution to discretize the space to get the wake center
	2. See what the wake center look like under turbulence and different wind speed
	3. Explore the relationship between Mtilt and Myaw (or the new transfered one) and the wake center
	4. Explore a way to handle the time-delay (lookup table, learn the dynamic, and etc)

Simulation cases:
	1. Look at the resolution
	2. Different windspeed and turbulence
			Uni 	[7,8,9,10]
			NTM-C 	[7,8,9,10]
			NTM-B 	[7,8,9,10]

=========== Marion LiDAR & Daniel Q-Blade Meeting 17/05/2024 ================
LIDAR:
	It only scans a circle, literally a circle without information in between
	It should be placed in a position of 1D to 2D 
	y and z component of the wind speed can be negelected

Q-blade:
	Helix in script can be acquired similar to what k*omega^2 do, Mtilt & Myaw -> MBC -> Feed in loop 
	.dll and .in should be overwritten when calling control

Nothing much going on, chill as fuck

Agenda:
	1. Downwind facing LIDAR details explanation
	2. My final research proposal, and research questions
	3. Current progress 
			a. Literature Survey
			b. Q-blade
			c. LIDAR selection

Feedback:
	1. Testing of controller is done in another paper (Steff not published one)
	2. Helix is used for below rated WT, that means a torque controller will be combined with the helix controller when implemented in the reality.
	3. For Q-Blade:
		a. figure out the controller setup:
			1) What is in the .dll soure code 
			2) The relationship between the .dll and script controller 
			3) How to implement Helix in the script
			4) Play around with the simulation condition, add turbulence 
	4. For the learning method
		a. Check the Daniel's paper 
		b. The GPR model

=========== Literature Review Draft
	1. Expand the too concised topic (wake, helix, lidar) and include more focused paper, at the same time, explain it more so that people who don't know shit understand
	2. Shorten the phase synchronization chapter 
	3. Define the problem throughly (wait for confirmation from Mees)
	4. Add connection among chapters
	5. Re-size figures
	
=========== Daniel Meeting 26/04/2024
Questions:
	1. How to use new turbine in q-blade for simulation 
		A: Import the project file and then simulation setup
	2. LIDAR(CW) & wake
		A. Configure in the turbine setting
	3. Why the hell I can't see any result from the TSR follow controller, is it because of the EE and CE version?
			calllib('QBladeDLL','advanceController_at_num',[0 0 0 0 0],0)
		A: This is fine because this is how this function is constructed
	4. Why my MATLAB keeps breaking when doing helix?
		A. By putting some files in the controllerFile, things work, I don't know how but that shit just worked
	
Feeedback:
	The idea is fine, and all things can be done in Q-blade. Enterprise version is on the way (if not then write him an email).
	To get to learn Q-blade, read Daniel's paper for setup the simulation, as well as the doc (https://docs.qblade.org/)
	When saving the simulation file, simulation -> export data -> .sim (in the file that turbine exist)
	1. Helix 
	2. Recreate LIDAR
	3. Controller
