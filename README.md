# IEA15MW_Helix_LiDAR
Code for master thesis: LiDAR enhanced Active Wake Mixing 

## File Description
### Materials
Reference paper, slides, etc

### Data
#### Figures
Data in the figure form
#### MAT
Matlab data block generated by the LiDAR sampling

### Functions
Matlab function
* writeDisconIPC: create discon.in file for the Helix 
* ZXTM_lidar: LiDAR ring sampling
* ZXTM_lidar2: LiDAR circle sampling

### Source
This file contains the project and simulation files for NREL5MW and IEA15MW wind turbines
* .qpr: Wind turbine project file
* .sim: Simulation file for turbine project with simulation definitions
* Folders: Supporting files for simulation

### Matlab.m Files
* Animation.m: Create a video based on LiDAR-sampled figures. Remember to change the folder name.
* Helix15MW_script: Helix and $k \omega^2$ torque controller for the IEA15MW in script
* Main.m: Run the helix for NREL5MW that was implemented not in the script but in discon.in
* IPC_Simulation: The supporting file for the main.m
* TryTorqueControl: Experimental file for checking the grammar or functionality
* komega2_5MW: Experimental file number 2
* debug: Debug functions and grammar check
* LiDARbasic_IEA15MW_script: Script code that activates torque control for the IEA15MW while performing data sampling at a downwind position (ring) using LiDAR
* LiDARdata_processing: Process LiDAR data by visualizing windspeed distribution in a snapshot, performing FFT for a single point throughout the simulation time to acquire the frequency and phase information of the helical wake, and performing FFT for a snapshot to obtain insights in turbulence distribution

### .qpr Files
Files that store the simulation result

### QBladeFunctionHelp
Doc for using q-blade functions in Matlab
